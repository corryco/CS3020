Task 1. LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) in a Binary Tree 

Development Task 1: 
Provide a program solution to the Lowest Common Ancestor problem. 
Implement a solution to the basic problem. You may assume that the graph is structured as a "binary tree"
Choose a unit testing framework. 
Create a repository on a git service such as Github. 
Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour.
Create sample data and also to identify the basic API for your solution.
Build initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.

Refine the solution, expanding the test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that push the limits of the solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these. 

Task 3. GitHub Access - Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.
